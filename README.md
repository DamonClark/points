This is a Rails application to collaboratively estimate stories.

## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems running the setup script:

```
$ ./bin/setup
```

## Environment Variables

`ORGANIZATION_LOGIN`: This is the organization name as it appears in the GitHub URL, for instance `orgname` in https://github.com/orgname. It is needed to check if users are a part of the organization. Ensure that your membership is set to _public_ when you visit https://github.com/orgs/orgname/people.

If you don't belong to any organization, you can set up one here: https://github.com/organizations/plan

Make sure you add your organization to the `.env` file like this:
```
ORGANIZATION_LOGIN=orgname
```
